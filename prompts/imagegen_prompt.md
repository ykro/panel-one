## INITIAL TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION: REFERENCE ANALYSIS & FIDELITY
First, exhaustively analyze the attached reference images. Extract the key facial features, hairstyles, and exact clothing details of the main characters. 

**HIGHEST PRIORITY:** The visual likeness to the provided photographs/images must be exact. You must maintain this identity consistent, adapting their proportions to the manga style but ensuring that their most important physical traits and **COLOR PALETTE** (hair, eyes, clothing) match the references rigorously throughout the entire generated page.

## OBJECTIVE
Generate **A SINGLE IMAGE** that captures a complete physical page of a finished professional full-color manga comic.

## VISUAL STYLE AND MEDIUM
* **Style:** Modern full-color Manga (similar to a high-quality "webtoon" or a color magazine page).
* **Finish:** The image must look like a high-quality final print.
* **Technique:** Clean digital Lineart (inking). Vibrant and professional coloring, mainly using a **"cel-shading"** style (hard shadows and defined color blocks to give volume) on characters, with dramatic lighting and rich, saturated colors.
* **Medium:** The paper should look smooth and high-quality, like illustration paper.

## STRUCTURE AND LAYOUT (WITH MARGINS)
* The sheet must contain a dynamic composition of manga-style panels, organized in Western reading order (left to right, top to bottom).
* **IMPORTANT:** The composition must maintain clean **WHITE MARGINS** around the entire set of panels. **No panel should touch the edge of the paper.** All panels must be contained within the safe print area.

## TEXT AND SFX INTEGRATION (LANGUAGE RULE)
* Dialogue must be integrated **INSIDE** the panels using **SPEECH BALLOONS** (bubbles) of varied shapes according to emotion.
* **CRITICAL LANGUAGE CONSTRAINT:** While this prompt is in English, **ALL TEXT INSIDE THE SPEECH BUBBLES MUST BE WRITTEN IN SPANISH.**
* Narration boxes can be rectangular.
* Include colored and stylized **SOUND EFFECTS (SFX)**, visually integrated into the action.

## CHARACTER CONSISTENCY (CRUCIAL)
Based on the references, maintain strict visual and color consistency of the main characters in every single panel. Faces and clothes must not morph between panels.

## NARRATIVE SEQUENCE TO DEVELOP
Develop the story on a single page with margins, using color manga visual language and placing the dialogues inside speech bubbles based on the following script:
